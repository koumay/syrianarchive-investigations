Russian Ministry of Defence documentation of  airstrike operations in Syria

This collection contains videos of Russian airstrikes publicly published on the Russian Ministry of Defenceâ€™s official YouTube channel since September 2015. Videos have verified by Bellingcat and other open source investigators (e.g,. Samir). Syrian Archive preserved this documentation, standardised the data, mapped it, and made it searchable. In some cases, Syrian Archive staff linked documentation from the Russian MoD to civilian documentation of alleged attacks on civilian infrastructure.

Civilian documentation of alleged Russian airstrikes

This collection contains videos published by individuals including journalists, activists, media and humanitarian groups, who claim to have have witnessed a Russian airstrike targeting civilians or civilian infrastructure in Syria. Syrian Archive preserved and verified video content in this collection and clustered it into an incident database.
