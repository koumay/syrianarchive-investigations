<h2>Background of Harasta</h2>

<p>Harsta is one of the strategic areas in the eastern Ghouta, and it's situated on
the international highway between Homs and Damascus. The city is overlooking a
large number of security and intelligence centers belonging to the Syrian
government, such as "The Management of military vehicles," "The Air Force
Intelligence branch," "111 Tunk depo", and others.</p>

<p>Harasta has a population of 34,184 (2007 census) and considers as the northern gate of the Syrian capital where it's far 5 km away from it.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZ-n0Os7qxw">The first demonstration video</a> we could find for Harasta back to 8 April 2011 which chanted 'The Syrian people will not be humiliated' and 'We want freedom.' Demonstrations <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZRuaThF6RU">continued during 2012</a>, while in April 2013 the Free Syrian Army took control of most of the city's neighborhoods. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRFw8CMNfkA">In this video</a>, one of the FSA fighters in a field interview states that they have taken over 75% of the city. </p>

<p>Harasta has been bombed by poison gas several times over the past years, such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jc4DGGySRCc">the strike on 20 October 2014</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGX5E3WgszQ">the one on 25 December 2014</a>.</p>

<h3>The battle of "They Were Wronged"</h3>

<p>Since rebel groups took control of Harsta, the region has become a battlefiled. On 22 July 2017, the Russian Ministry of Defense <a href="http://sn4hr.org/blog/2017/11/09/48353/">announced that a de-escalation agreement had been signed</a> for Eastern Ghouta. On 16 August 2017, a Failaq al Rahman representative and a Russian representative signed an agreement that established Failaq al Rahman’s inclusion in the de-escalation zone, to come into effect on 18 August.</p>

<p>However, SOHR <a href="http://www.syriahr.com/en/?p=75034">reported that government bombing resumed</a> in Eastern Ghouta on 27 September 2017, <a href="http://syriadirect.org/news/eight-children-dead-scores-injured-after-mortar-shell-strikes-east-ghouta-kindergarten/">one of thoes attakcs targeted a kindergarten</a> on 6 November in Harasta resulting eight children dead and scores injured.</p>

<p>In mid-November 2017 Syrian rebels in Harasta <a href="https://twitter.com/harastaa/status/930881389985222656">launched a military operation</a> called "They were Wronged" against positions of the Syrian Arab Army in Harasta. Ahrar al-Sham announced the launch of this battle as a response to the deteriorating humanitarian situation, and the repeated bombing of the regime in the villages and towns in Eastern Ghouta.</p>

<h2>When did it happen?</h2>

<p>According to several testimonies collected by Syrians for Truth and Justice the first attack happened at exactly 5 PM (Damascus local time). Hassan al-Kabees, a resident of Harasta who were present at the scene of the first attack, assured STJ that more than 15 ground-to-ground missiles landed on the city on January 28, 2018, 10 of which were loaded with incendiary substances (similar to napalm), where he said:</p>

<p>"At 5:00 p.m., I saw the rockets landed on the buildings facing my house, and they had earlier landed directly on a huge population centre and resulted in burn injuries for about 18 civilians, as well as the material damage caused by the shelling, where the napalm burned over 50 houses in our neighbourhood only. While I was helping in putting out fires and rescuing the wounded, the Syrian regime shelled the same area again with ground-to-ground missiles loaded with explosive materials in order to make the fires devour as much space as possible. Fire suppression process lasted more than 12 hours, the more we tried to put it out, the more it flared up elsewhere.</p>

<p>Hassan continued that the Syrian regular forces had bombed Harasta again on January 30, 2018, specifically at 6:00 p.m., in order to cause panic and fear among people. In this regard, he added:</p>

<p>"On that day, Harasta was shelled with more than 25 ground-to-ground missiles, six of which were loaded with incendiary substances, burning down more than five buildings, as well as a number of shops and buses, the regime also targeted the region with explosive rockets to hinder the rescue operations and the extinguish of fires. The regime deliberately shelled the residential compound, which is one of the most populated areas in Harasta, noting that there is no military headquarters within these targeted areas. We feel like the earth closed in on us, we don’t know where to go, we are in a state of a constant displacement, and we are no longer able to settle in one place."</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1G_Jp_zZRg">In one of the videos published by Syrian Civil Defense</a> on 28 Jan 2018 the moon can be seen in the sky and it's almost fully, see below:</p>

<p><img src="assets/harasta12.jpg" alt="harasta12" />

<p>The Syrian Archive was able to confirm <a href="http://www.moongiant.com/phase/01/28/2018">the moon llumination was 87%</a> on 28 Jan 2018 from Moongiant site:</p>

<p><img src="assets/harasta14.png" alt="harasta10" /></p>

<h2>The weapons used</h2>

<p>As indicated in witness testimonies, the Local Council of Harasta city statement and the above videos, the attack was carried out using surface-to-surface missiles. The Local Council of Harast <a href="https://www.facebook.com/localcouncilofHarasta/photos/pcb.2083495491883113/2083495231883139/?type=3&amp;theater">published photos of a munition</a> that is claims was used in the attack:</p>

<p><img src="assets/harasta15.jpg" alt="harasta10" /></p>

<p>Ahmed al-Talli, a fighter of the Syrian armed opposition, told STJ that during the recent escalation campaign, Harasta used to be bombed with ground-to-ground missiles or the so-called "elephant" rockets, noting that the Syrian regular forces had modified these rockets, by loading them with incendiary substances, and in this regard, he continued:</p>

<p>"The "Elephant" rocket is a "Grad" missile, which has ranges between 20 to 40, the Syrian regime amended it, by removing its explosive warhead and installing another, carrying a large quantity of explosives and incendiary substances, which may be soap or rubber added to gasoline. The amount of incendiary substances the Elephant rocket can be loaded with, is the same of the explosive substances’ its head can carry."</p>
