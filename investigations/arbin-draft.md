## Background of Arbin

Arbin (or Arbeel in the Syriac language) is a city in Damascus countryside governorate, Eastern Ghouta, Located about 7 kilometers north-east of the center of Damascus. Nearby localities include Kafr Batna and Saqba to the south, Zamalka and Ein Tarma to the southwest, and Harasta to the north, with an estimated population of 44,934 (2004 census). 

The city saw demonstrations against Assad regime early in the Syrian uprising. [One of the first demonstrations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_obJ6g9BMI), dating from 3 April 2011, documents demonstrators chanting for freedom. Security [forces often intervened](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0b4lXsnD0E) to break up protests. Swiftly the city became an [important hub for organizing protests](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPZoGoGHx8c). In December 2012, Arbin city [fell under control by the Free Syrian Army](http://www.understandingwar.org/press-media/graphsandstat/battle-damascus-current-state-play-syria), since then the city has emerged from the Syrian government control.

Government forces initially laid siege to the opposition-held enclave in the Eastern Ghouta [in April 2013](http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/HRCouncil/CoISyria/A-HRC-37-72_EN.pdf) which including Arbin. Since that date, inhabitants of Arbin city, same as other Eastern Ghouta cities, still living under the siege and bombing. 

### Previous attacks

Syrian Government forces used chemical weapons continuously against Eastern Ghouta; the deadliest attack was in the early hours of 21 August 2013.
