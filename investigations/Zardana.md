On Friday, 8 June 2018, the Russian Defense Ministry [denied](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://russian.rt.com/world/news/521128-minoborony-oprovergli-udar-siriya&sa=D&ust=1538476154390000) bombing Zardana town in the Syrian province of Idlib by Russian aircraft, the ministry said in its statement that fierce fighting took place in this region between the large detachments of the "Al-Nusra Front" (designated as a terrorist organization in Russia and a number of countries) and "Jaysh al-Islam" using heavy artillery.

It is worth mentioning that contrary to what the Russian Defense Ministry said, the air strike is most likely to be Russian for several reasons primarily because Russian and Syrian aircraft are the only active ones in the region, iand secondarily, Syrian planes are unable to fly at night, ; according to a statement made by [Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://ria.ru/syria/20160921/1477468029.html&sa=D&ust=1538476154390000) to the Russian Information Agency (RIU).

It should be noted that Zardana, according to several media sources including [Step News agency](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://stepagency-sy.net/archives/198035&sa=D&ust=1538476154391000), had seen some incidents of fighting between Jaysh Al-Ahrar and Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham, and the fighting was renewed on June 7, 2018, resulting in the deaths and injuries including civilians, on after a dispute broke out between them the previous evening.

## The conclusion:

Zardana town, north of Idlib, was targeted on Thursday night, June 7, 2018, at approximately 21:05, with an airstrike followed by another one about half an hour later, by aircraft likely to be Russian. The airstrikes targeted a [residential neighborhood](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://earth.google.com/web/@36.04395964,36.75224262,319.55971579a,147.93847951d,35y,145.27914805h,0.15301545t,0r&sa=D&ust=1538476154403000) south of Zardana, near [Saad bin Mua'dh mosque](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://earth.google.com/web/@36.04418524,36.75250114,319.86556206a,452.25160956d,35y,145.27877064h,0.15302276t,-0r/data%3DCmgaZhJeCiUweDE1MjU3MmM1MGRjOGQ0ZGY6MHhhMmZkYzhkY2Y3ZGQwODdiGTCE4n2xBUJAIXdiJ3Y6YEJAKiNTYWFkIGJpbiBmb3JiaWQKY29sbGVjdG9yIChXZXN0ZXJuKRgCIAEoAg&sa=D&ust=1538476154403000), killing 44 people, injuring dozens and destroying dozens of homes.

Thermobaric rockets were used in one of the two airstrikes, based on the destruction of the entire residential neighborhood, and the crater depth of 10 meters.

The Russian Defense Ministry denied its warplanes were involved, and instead blamed the attack on artillery shelling between two fighting factions of Jaysh Al-Ahrar and Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham. Although the fighting started on the previous day, but there were no clashes in the targeted area, and all witnesses and injured confirmed that the bombardment was from aircraft flying that night, where high-explosive weapons were used.
