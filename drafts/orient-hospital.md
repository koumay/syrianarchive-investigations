## Where did it happen?

## When did it happen?


Witness statements of the attack was provided by Syrians for Truth and Justice.
One of the nurses, who was at Orient Hospital at the time of the attack, spoke to Syrians for Truth and justice/STJ about the details of the incident, saying:

"On the morning of February 5, 2018, while I was checking the patients in the hospital, a warning came from the security and safety team that the hospital should be evacuated, particularly, that Russian warplanes had raided Al-Ma'ra Central Hospital a day earlier. So, the wounded and the reviewers were immediately transferred to the basements. At 8:45 a.m., the warplanes carried out four raids on the hospital, causing panic and fear state among the sick and the medical staff as well. However, dust and fragments scattered everywhere, but thank God there were no injuries among the medical staff or reviewers as the damage was limited to material, the upper floors were entirely damaged and the hospital was completely out of service."

In a cross-checked certificate, a reviewer, who was also at the hospital at the time of shelling, said that at 8:45 a.m., while he was in the hospital with a view to visiting one of his sick relatives, warplanes believed to be Russian carried out four air strikes on the hospital, causing destruction in the building specially the upper floors, he continued saying:

"It was a very difficult moment when fear and panic dominated all those in the basements, and the dust filled the place, there were fragments of rubble flying around. It's hard to describe the horrible scene in a few words; the raids caused the hospital to be completely out of service, due to falling a rocket in the operating room causing entire destruction. Then the Civil Defense teams worked to extinguish the fires that had been erupted as a result of the shelling, and they evacuated the sick and the medical staff out of the hospital in case they shelled it again."

Obayda al-Othman, the director of the Civil Defense Center in Kafranbel, spoke to STJ explaining what happened:

"A day before targeting Orient Hospital, specifically on February 4, 2018, the Russian planes flew in all the liberated areas, where a Russian warplane bombed Kafranbel with highly explosive rockets targeting the popular market and houses of civilians, causing death of 9 civilians and dozens of injured. Anyway, the following day, Russian warplanes bombed Kafranbel Surgical Hospital or known as Orient Hospital with more than 3 air raids, causing destruction of the upper floors, in addition to a rocket dropped in the operating room and the intensive care room. So, immediately the Civil Defense teams rushed to the hospital to evacuate patients and reviewers to other medical points. However, these raids caused the hospital to get completely out of service, without having human damage."
