## Background of Harasta

Harsta is one of the strategic areas in the eastern Ghouta, and it's situated on the international highway between Homs and Damascus. The city is overlooking a large number of security and intelligence centers belonging to the Syrian government, such as "The Management of military vehicles," "The Air Force Intelligence branch," "The Tunk depo 111", and others.

Harasta has a population of 34,184 (2007 census) and considers as the northern gate of the Syrian capital where it's far 5 km away from it.

[The first demonstration video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZ-n0Os7qxw) we could find for Harasta back to 8 April 2011 which chanted 'The Syrian people will not be humiliated' and 'We want freedom.' Demonstrations [continued during 2012](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZRuaThF6RU), while in April 2013 the Free Syrian Army took control of most of the city's neighborhoods, [in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRFw8CMNfkA), one of the FSA fighters in a field interview states that they have taken over 75% of the city. 

Harasta has been bombed by poison gas several times over the past years, such as [the strike on 20 October 2014](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jc4DGGySRCc) and [the one on 25 December 2014](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGX5E3WgszQ).

### The battle of "They Were Wronged"

Since rebel groups took control of Harsta, the region has become a battlefiled. On 22 July 2017, the Russian Ministry of Defense [announced that a de-escalation agreement had been signed](http://sn4hr.org/blog/2017/11/09/48353/) for Eastern Ghouta. On 16 August 2017, a Failaq al Rahman representative and a Russian representative signed an agreement that established Failaq al Rahman’s inclusion in the de-escalation zone, to come into effect on 18 August.

However, SOHR [reported that government bombing resumed](http://www.syriahr.com/en/?p=75034) in Eastern Ghouta on 27 September 2017, [one of thoes attakcs targeted a kindergarten](http://syriadirect.org/news/eight-children-dead-scores-injured-after-mortar-shell-strikes-east-ghouta-kindergarten/) on 6 November in Harasta resulting eight children dead and scores injured.

In mid-November 2017 Syrian rebels in Harasta [launched a military operation](https://twitter.com/harastaa/status/930881389985222656) called "They were Wronged" against positions of the Syrian Arab Army in Harasta. Ahrar al-Sham announced the launch of this battle as a response to the deteriorating humanitarian situation, and the repeated bombing of the regime in the villages and towns in Eastern Ghouta.
