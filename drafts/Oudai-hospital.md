## What Happened

On January 29th 2018 local sources reported that Owdai Hospital in Saraqib was targeted by an airstrike, following an earlier airstrike that damaged the hospital on January 22nd 2018.
Edlib Media Center [published a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQAVO0VECTs) showing what they claim to be the first moment of the attack that bombed the Oudai Al Hussein hospital.

The [Syrian Network for Human Rights reported](http://sn4hr.org/sites/news/2018/01/29/russian-forces-shelled-oday-saraqeb-hospital-saraqeb-city-idlib-suburbs-january-29/) that the hospital was treating victims of an earlier bombing at the New Potato Market in Saraqib January 29th 2018 when the hospital was attacked.

[Assi Press published photos at 09:35 Damascus time](https://www.facebook.com/assipress/posts/1752369028149274) of injured people being treated as a result of the attack that targeted the potato market. 

Citizen journalist Hadi AL Abdallah [published a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHf5r3aPhgU) showing the civil defense rescuing injured people as a result of the attack on the Saraqib Potato market.

Al Abdallah said in the video: "11 killed and many injured in a new massacre committed by the airforce which bombed the potato market."

Edlib Media Center [published a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEh1xqI9UJ8) about the potato market bombing which shows killed and injured people as a result of the airtsrike as well as damaged trucks. We can see clearly in the photo below a possible crater as a result of the airstrike that targeted this location.

According to witness testimonies collected by the Syrians for Truth and Justice, the killed and injured people from the potato market attack were moved to Oudai hospital which was then bombed by the airforce.

We have identified stills from [Smart News Agency Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBoFbO0YiYE) as well as [Thiqa news agency video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi_h0TDek5A) that shows the Oudai hospital before and after the attack. In the still above we can see the dead bodies as a result of the potato market attack. In the second still below, we can see the damage of the same location after the airstrike that targeted the hospital.

Citizen journalist Hadi AL Abdallah [published another video in the same day of the potato market attack on Jan 29th 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1LYNZ5-1BA) showing the Oudai hospital damage as a result of an airstrike that bombed the hospital after the potato market attack.

He stated in the video:"After the morning massacre that was committed by the airforce in the potato market which resulted of 11 killed people and many injured, Those injured were transfered to Oudai (Ehsan) hospital in Saraqib to be treated. But after this the Russian airforce targeted this hospital which resulted of the hospital being out of service completely. Big crater resulted of a munition used by the airforce. Few of the media staff were injured as a result of this attack. Some of the injured people from the potato market that were transfer to be treated in this hospital got killed as a result of the airstrike. Some killed people are still under the rubbles until this moment. This is the only hospital in this city which is not out of service. Ambulance cars were damaged too."

Aljisr TV [published a a video of an interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmcvVs1l3LY) with Dr. Ali Al faraj, the deputy of Oudai hospital. He said: "This morning the potato market was bombed, then the emergency center, The blood bank, and the Oudai hospital were bombed after in the same day. The injured people from the potato market attack were all transfered into the Oudai hospital which was then bombed as you can see here. As a result of this attack the hospital is out of service now. 3 medical staff were injured. Renovating the hospital building will be very difficult after this attack."

The bomb landed in front of the main hospital building, leaving a large crater as [shown a video published](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi_h0TDek5A) by Thiqa news agency, and resulting in the collapse of a warehouse containing medical supplies. The video shows the Syrian Civil Defence dug the corpse of an adult male out of the debris from the attack after the initial rescue operation.

## Where did it happen?

The Syrian Archive team created a panoramio image using the [video of Sham News Agency](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9H0OWyzd8jo&t=1s) which was published after the attack. We identified the hospital building and another building through comparing the image with Google earth satellite imagery.

## When did it happen?

Witness statements of the attack were provided by Syrians for Truth and Justice.

Ahmed al-Asaad, a doctor who was in the hospital at the time of attacking it, spoke to STJ about what happened:
"At about 08:00 .am. January 29, 2018, Russian military aircraft shelled the potato market in Saraqib, which resulted in dozens of civilian casualties. So immediately, the ambulance teams transported the injured and the dead to Uday al-Hussein Hospital, but the warplanes re-attacked the hospital with two vacuum rockets, so it got completely out of service and caused death of a civilian and wounded some members of the medical staff at the hospital. Anyway, the shelling also destroyed the room where the dead had been transported from the potato market. So Saraqib became without any medical points to provide medical services to the injured and to the locals as well."

Hassan Al-Hassaan, a Civil Defense worker in Idlib province, told STJ that the observatories monitoring air traffic in the skies of Saraqib informed them on the morning of January 29, 2018, that warplanes believed to be Russian shelled the city's potato market, so the Civil Defense teams directed to the site to move the injured and lift the dead from rubbles, they were about 13 dead in addition to dozens of wounded, and then I transferred them to Uday al-Hussein Hospital in the city, he continued:
“Almost half an hour after we transferred the dead and wounded to the hospital, the warplanes shelled Uday al-Hussein Hospital at about 8:00 .am., leading to massive destruction, and immediately the rescue teams again went to the impact site to evacuate the injured out of fear of another raid, that led the hospital to be completely out of service.

In another testimony by Abu Arab, the supervisor of a military aircraft observatory in Saraqib, spoke to STJ saying:
"At 7:35 am on January 29, 2018, a warplane took off from the Hmeimim Military Base in Latakia province, flied toward north of Syria at 7:40 a.m., and targeted the city's potato market with explosive rockets which led to a massacre, so we immediately informed the Civil Defense teams to go to the bombing site, but the same warplane targeted the hospital of Uday al-Hussein with two vacuum rockets after about half an hour, the matter that caused the hospital to be completely out of service.

Safi al Hammam, an activist from Saraqib, also spoke to STJ saying:
“The day of 29 January 2018, was a bloody day in every sense of the word, as the city was shelled with various kinds of weapons by Russian aircraft from Sokhoi, which targeted the potato market with several rockets, resulting in dozens of civilian casualties, whom were later transferred to Uday al-Hussein Hospital in Saraqib. These warplanes targeted the hospital with two vacuum rockets, killing one civilian and injuring dozens, in addition to getting the hospital completely out of service, and then the Russian warplanes targeted it once again with dual raids, injuring several media personnel. However, the city also witnessed a massive wave of displacement towards the border areas north of the province, due to the violent shelling of the city.

According to STJ reporter, who was in the hospital at the time of the attack, a state of panic and horror controlled all the sick and injured in the hospital, after they knew that the military aircraft observatory had tracked warplanes, believed to be Russian, approaching toward Uday al-Hussein Hospital on the morning of January 29, 2018, so everyone was transferred to the ground floor of the hospital. Meantime those planes dropped two vacuum rockets targeted directly the hospital building, causing injuries among members of the medical staff, as well as several media men, who were in the outside campus of the hospital, in addition to the significant material damage caused because of the shelling.

# Flight Data Analysis

To provide a further layer of verification, the Syrian Archive cross-referenced findings from the videos and witness testimony with flight observation data from a spotter organisation. This process necessitated analysing observation data for flights between 7:00 and 10:00, the period directly before and after the reported attack between 7:30 and 8:30 as was claimed by media activists. See below:

Through comparing where flights were observed, the type of aircraft observed, the time flights were observed, and the direction flights were heading, and comparing this data to geolocation conducted in earlier steps, the Syrian Archive was able to identify several flights potentially responsible for the attack (several fixed-wing Russian aircraft), seen circling in the immediate vicinity of the geolocated attack site starting from 7:45 AM. Previous research has found that circling flights typically indicate target acquisition and/or preparation for an imminent attack.

While there is no direct evidence available that one of the observed aircrafts was involved in the attack on Saraqib the presence of these aircrafts increase the likelihood that an air attack occurred at this location and the time stated by the citizen reporters as well as humanitarian groups, and estimated also using imagery from the attack.
