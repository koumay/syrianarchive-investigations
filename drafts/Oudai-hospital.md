## Where did it happen?

## When did it happen?


Witness statements of the attack were provided by Syrians for Truth and Justice.

Ahmed al-Asaad, a doctor who was in the hospital at the time of attacking it, spoke to STJ about what happened:
"At about 08:00 .am. January 29, 2018, Russian military aircraft shelled the potato market in Saraqib, which resulted in dozens of civilian casualties. So immediately, the ambulance teams transported the injured and the dead to Uday al-Hussein Hospital, but the warplanes re-attacked the hospital with two vacuum rockets, so it got completely out of service and caused death of a civilian and wounded some members of the medical staff at the hospital. Anyway, the shelling also destroyed the room where the dead had been transported from the potato market. So Saraqib became without any medical points to provide medical services to the injured and to the locals as well."

Hassan Al-Hassaan, a Civil Defense worker in Idlib province, told STJ that the observatories monitoring air traffic in the skies of Saraqib informed them on the morning of January 29, 2018, that warplanes believed to be Russian shelled the city's potato market, so the Civil Defense teams directed to the site to move the injured and lift the dead from rubbles, they were about 13 dead in addition to dozens of wounded, and then I transferred them to Uday al-Hussein Hospital in the city, he continued:
“Almost half an hour after we transferred the dead and wounded to the hospital, the warplanes shelled Uday al-Hussein Hospital at about 8:00 .am., leading to massive destruction, and immediately the rescue teams again went to the impact site to evacuate the injured out of fear of another raid, that led the hospital to be completely out of service.

In another testimony by Abu Arab, the supervisor of a military aircraft observatory in Saraqib, spoke to STJ saying:
"At 7:35 am on January 29, 2018, a warplane took off from the Hmeimim Military Base in Latakia province, flied toward north of Syria at 7:40 a.m., and targeted the city's potato market with explosive rockets which led to a massacre, so we immediately informed the Civil Defense teams to go to the bombing site, but the same warplane targeted the hospital of Uday al-Hussein with two vacuum rockets after about half an hour, the matter that caused the hospital to be completely out of service.

Safi al Hammam, an activist from Saraqib, also spoke to STJ saying:
“The day of 29 January 2018, was a bloody day in every sense of the word, as the city was shelled with various kinds of weapons by Russian aircraft from Sokhoi, which targeted the potato market with several rockets, resulting in dozens of civilian casualties, whom were later transferred to Uday al-Hussein Hospital in Saraqib. These warplanes targeted the hospital with two vacuum rockets, killing one civilian and injuring dozens, in addition to getting the hospital completely out of service, and then the Russian warplanes targeted it once again with dual raids, injuring several media personnel. However, the city also witnessed a massive wave of displacement towards the border areas north of the province, due to the violent shelling of the city.

According to STJ reporter, who was in the hospital at the time of the attack, a state of panic and horror controlled all the sick and injured in the hospital, after they knew that the military aircraft observatory had tracked warplanes, believed to be Russian, approaching toward Uday al-Hussein Hospital on the morning of January 29, 2018, so everyone was transferred to the ground floor of the hospital. Meantime those planes dropped two vacuum rockets targeted directly the hospital building, causing injuries among members of the medical staff, as well as several media men, who were in the outside campus of the hospital, in addition to the significant material damage caused because of the shelling.
